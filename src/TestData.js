It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - A man-in-the-middle vulnerability exists, known as     'httpoxy', due to a failure to properly resolve     namespace conflicts in accordance with RFC 3875 section     4.1.18. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is set based     on untrusted user data in the 'Proxy' header of HTTP     requests. The HTTP_PROXY environment variable is used by     some web client libraries to specify a remote proxy     server. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, via a crafted 'Proxy' header in an HTTP request,     to redirect an application's internal HTTP traffic to an     arbitrary proxy server where it may be observed or     manipulated. (CVE-2016-5385)\n\n  - An overflow condition exists in the php_bz2iop_read()     function within file ext/bz2/bz2.c due to improper     handling of error conditions. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a crafted request, to     execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-5399)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the GD Graphics Library (libgd),     specifically in the gdImageScaleTwoPass() function     within file gd_interpolation.c, due to improper     validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,     remote attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of     service condition. (CVE-2016-6207)\n\n  - An integer overflow condition exists in the     virtual_file_ex() function within file     Zend/zend_virtual_cwd.c due to improper validation of     user-supplied input. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition     or the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6289)\n\n  - A use-after-free error exists within the file     ext/session/session.c when handling 'var_hash'     destruction. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can     exploit this to deference already freed memory,     resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2016-6290)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the     exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE() function within file     ext/exif/exif.c. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can     exploit this to cause a denial of service condition or     disclose memory contents. (CVE-2016-6291)\n\n  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the     exif_process_user_comment() function within file     ext/exif/exif.c.

An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     deference already freed memory, resulting in the     execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6295)\n\n  - A heap-based buffer overflow condition exists in the     simplestring_addn() function within file simplestring.c     due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service condition or the execution of     arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-6296)\n\n  - An integer overflow condition exists in the     php_stream_zip_opener() function within file     ext/zip/zip_stream.c due to improper validation of     user-supplied input when handling zip streams. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service condition or the execution of     arbitrary code.

An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition     or the execution of arbitrary code. (VulnDB 141953)\n\n  - A NULL write flaw exists in the GD Graphics Library     (libgd) in the gdImageColorTransparent() function due to     improper handling of negative transparent colors.

(VulnDB 142104)\n\n  - An overflow condition exists in the php_url_prase_ex()     function due to improper validation of user-supplied     input.
